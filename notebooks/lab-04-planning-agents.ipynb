        "This separation of concerns makes the agent more robust. The planner can focus on the high-level strategy without getting bogged down in execution details, and the executor can focus on the immediate step without needing to understand the overall goal."

        "2. **Dynamic Argument Substitution**: The current argument substitution is hard-coded (`<summary_from_step_3>`). Generalize it. The planner should be able to specify a placeholder like `{{step_2_result}}` in the arguments, and the executor should be able to replace it with the actual value from the `execution_context`.\n",
        "3. **Create a More Complex Plan**: Think of a more complex goal, like \"Find the top 3 trending news articles, summarize each one, and save them to three separate files.\" Modify the `PlannerLLM` to generate a plan for this goal. You will likely need to add a new tool, `get_trending_articles()`.\n",
